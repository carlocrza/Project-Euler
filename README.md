# Project-Euler
Personal solutions to Project Euler challenges, an online series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems.

Project Euler is an online site created in 2001 dedicated to a series of complex mathematical and computational problems, meant to be solved by programming. The site is updated weekly with new problems, currently in the order of hundreds.

Each file in this repository is my personal solution to a unique Project Euler problem.
